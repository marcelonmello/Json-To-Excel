Nuestro objetivo es suplantar el paquete de 80.000 USD que el MIT ofrece por uno de 100.000 pesos moneda local, donde se puedan adquirir las tecnologías básicas de fabricación digital.\r\n\r\n\r\nLas máquinas de este paquete son las siguientes:\r\nImpresoras 3d tipo Prusa i3\r\nScanner tipo Kinect\r\nRouter de media Placa 1.2 x 1.2mts\r\nCortadora láser pequeña, ver proyecto LaOS\r\nCortadora de Vinilo\r\n\r\nSoldadores, Arduino y estación electrónica de medición\r\nEn la Conferencia FAB9 en Yokohama se le pidió a grupo de holanda que explore un Small Fablab Suite para el fab ab de 10.000

Francesco Bombardi (*) who, after getting into contact with Fab Lab Amsterdam and many professionals working in other laboratories (Enrico Bassi Fab Lab Torino, Massimo Menichinelli Aalto Factory), decided to replicate the same experience in Reggio Emilia. After several consultations, the project was first presented to a number of possible promoters such as Reggio Emilia Innovation (REI), the Province of Reggio Emilia and the City Council, before being approved by the Board of Directors in July 2012. The settlement on the premises of Spazio Gerra (made available by Reggio Emilia City Council) took place in September 2012, while the official opening was held on October 27 of the same year.\r\n\r\nThe Fab Lab Reggio Emilia's mission is twofold: on one hand to support the companies in the paths of innovation and development of new ideas and projects through the development of people and interdisciplinary skills.\r\nThe Fab Lab launched  the  IDEA CHALLENGE formula, preparing a detailed brief with the company and guiding work groups (interdisciplinary)  to realize prototypes in one-two days time, using digital fabrication tools and know-how.\r\nProducts realized : 12 V Coffe Machine ( with Redox) , New Products in Polistirolo Espanso ( with CoopBox ), Digital Garden Kit ( in progress with IREN Rinnovabili), stencil customization for painting  decoration indoor ( with Litokol), Gadgets for Fotografia Europea 2013, condom twitter display ( with Industree for Durex).\r\n\r\nThe Fab Lab Reggio Emilia is connected with Università di Modena e Reggio, Dipartimento di Scienze e Metodi di Ingegneria where Francesco Bombardi is helding a course of Industrial Design rapid prototyping.\r\nOne of the project-ptrototype developed by the student has been presented to Ferrari in Maranello.\r\nAnother was presented during the BarCamper tour ( accelerometro for guitar)\r\n\r\nIn the mean time Fab Lab is choosing some topics to research as to be able to  internally produce prototypes and propose them to users , institutions or companies.\r\nProducts : 3D Printer adaptation (with Redox) , window dynamic display unit (with UnderDesign) , fab –valigia for schools (with Chiara Ferraboschi and Officina Educativa), Paesaggi di Formaggio (with Parmigiano Reggiano)\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, to allow individuals and / or communities to access tools useful to learn, experiment, prototype and self-produce, contributing to the emergence of new entrepreneurial projects.\r\nWorkshops: 3d printing, 3d scanning, laser cutting, robotics, tangible diagrams, 3d modeling, interaction design, fashion design, jewelry, cnc milling.\r\nWorkshop for schools and dedicated workshops for architects and managers ( INARC, CNA Emilia Romagna, MUSE Trento)\r\n\r\nReggio Emilia Innovazione (REI) has studied the economic feasibility and has also directly funded the fab lab's activities. The City Council has provided the location in the heart of the city center, materializing the idea of an Urban Factory, in close contact with the citizens and city's cultural events thanks to Spazio Gerra managers.\r\n\r\nThe fab lab is powered by Reggio Emilia Innovazione and managed and directed by Francesco Bombardi,  with the collaboration of Fernando Arias Sandoval.\r\nSeveral public and private actors have shared the fab lab's mission and took part in the project directly contributing for its realization.

Luoghi che diano nuovo significato alla “ricerca di lavoro,” rendendolo non più “individuazione di chi possa darmi qualcosa da fare” bensì “autogenerazione di un lavoro per me”, facendo leva sullo spirito di innovazione e di imprenditorialità di chi voglia beneficiare delle grandi opportunità che oggi offrono le  moderne tecnologie e la web-economy, sempre in  chiave globale e non limitatamente nazionale e microlocale.\r\n\r\n Il Veneto (e Padova in particolare) è tradizionalmente custode di enormi giacimenti di cultura e pensiero ed anche storico portatore di una cultura imprenditoriale basata sulla concretezza e sulla operosità, vocazionalmente strutturata non tanto nella dimensione della grande impresa quanto in quella del pro-attivo laboratorio artigianale a rete/distretto: un contesto particolarmente coerente e compatibile con le linee di sviluppo della  “terza rivoluzione industriale” e cioè, quella dei “makers” e del 3d printing.\r\n\r\n3D PRINT\r\n\r\nLa stampa 3d è il cavallo di battaglia di ogni FabLab. Una tecnologia\r\nincredibilmente versatile che ha rivoluzionato l’industria grazie alle\r\ninfinite possibilità dell’additive manufacturing. Il FabLab è inoltre\r\nrivenditore autorizzato Sharebot.\r\nSono disponibili 4 stampanti 3D a tecnologia FDM e una a tecnologia DLP\r\n\r\nLaser CO2\r\n\r\n Il laser permette di tagliare e incidere pressoché ogni materiale non\r\nmetallico. Una sorgente di luce infrarossa viene concentrata tramite\r\nspecchi e lenti fino a raggiungere forma puntiforme. L’enorme calore,\r\nsu una minuscola superficie permette di ottenere risultati puliti e\r\nprecisi ed angoli netti. Dimensioni di taglio massime: 60X40 cm\r\n\r\nCNC\r\n\r\n La cnc è uno strumento estremamente versatile. Partendo dal pieno\r\nmateriale o viene asportato da una fresa rotante. In questo modo è\r\npossibile tagliare, spianare, forare, incidere e addirittura modellare\r\nin 3d. Tutto in modo altamente automatizzato, partendo da disegni\r\nrealizzati al computer. Dimensioni di lavoro massime: 80X60 cm\r\n\r\nElettroniLab\r\n\r\nUna postazione elettronica attrezzata, computer, due postazioni di\r\nsaldatura e tutto il necessario per produrre circuiti stampati.\r\nNell’ElettroniLab del FabLab puoi riparare, progettare, assemblare\r\ndispositivi elettronici.\r\n\r\nFai-Da-Te\r\n\r\nQuale è lo scopo di un FabLab? Fabbricare! Con pressoché ogni genere\r\ndi attrezzo gli ciò che puoi fare è limitato solo dalla fantasia. Che\r\ntu debba cambiare la camera d’aria della bicicletta o restaurare una\r\nsedia del 1800 qui potrai farlo. Troverai trapani, seghetti\r\naltrnativi, seghe circolari, frese, cacciaviti, pialletti e molto\r\naltro! Abbiamo a disposizione anche un sistema di aspirazione\r\ncentralizzato e l'aria compressa!\r\n\r\n\r\nPrototipazione\r\n\r\n Il network del TalentLab al tuo servizio, il nostro supporto per la\r\nmodellazione delle tue idee e tutte le fasi della prototipazione per\r\nrenderle concrete.\r\nContattaci tramite i ticket o partecipa ad una nostra presentazione\r\nper tutte le informazioni.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSiamo aperti dalle 9 alle 18 tutti i giorni dal Lun al Ven.

We have been helped by Francesco Bombardi and Fernando Arias of the Fablab Reggio-Emilia, Andrea Danielli of Make in Italy association and Massimo Menichinelli of Make in Italy CDB fundation Onlus. After visiting several Fablabs in Italy (Fablab Torino, Fablab Reggio-Emilia, MakeinBo) and done our homework of studying several fablab in Europe (Fablab Barcellona, Aalto Factory, etc) we decided that it was time to open a Fablab in Parma.\r\n\r\nON/OFF Fablab Parma is a brainchild of \"ON/OFF Officina di Coworking\" which is a innovative service of the office of the Mayor of Parma and it is managed by \"Gruppo Scuola\" in collaboration with the Association of Social Promotion ON/OFF.\r\n\r\nON/OFF is a three stages project divided in CO-MAKE-SELL: COWORKING - FABLAB - MAKER'S SHOP.\r\n\r\nThe Coworking opened its doors on the 23rd of November 2013with the main goal to promote an aggregation point of freelancers and Startups. Currently we have people from different sectors from webdesigners, software engineers, film makers, journalists, writers, illustrators, graphic designers, European funding researchers, app developer, etc.\r\nRecently On/off partner also with an incubator (Parma-in)for Start-ups.\r\n\r\nThe different skills has created an environment rich of creativity and sparked new business opportunity for the professionals working there.\r\n\r\nThe help of the local government of Parma has been essential to help the growing of the project, since they helped giving the use of the location were at the moment the Coworking if base and where the Fablab has a place to live. The Fablab is looking for a bigger place since we are growing in number of associated and in number of Tools at the disposal of the community.\r\n\r\nOn/Off is also a universe made of space for artist to expose their work, for designer to create their clothes to the several workshops we have done till now.\r\n\r\nWE are very weary and it is of paramount importance to educate for this we work together with local schools and showing the interesting world of the 3d Printing, or with coderdojo teaching the beauty of coding software to young kids.\r\nWe are doing several courses to introduce the 3D printing revolution open to everyone and we are in the process to work on a new calendar of workshops starting in September/October 2014.\r\n\r\nWe are part of the \"virtuous network\" it's a network of organization who manage to be in continuos connection with the local people, being self-sustainable and create a link between the people and the territory where they live.\r\n\r\nThe coworkers and fabbers give back to the community as volunteer on several social projects, this is part of the mission we agree when we enter in ON/OFF Coworiking and Fablab and this is the reason the price of admission to use the services is lower than other places, because we give back to the community of Parma.\r\n\r\n At the moment we fulfilled only two stages of the project: the Coworking and the Fablab. At the moment we are working on the next phase, thus the Maker's shop, where the digital manufacturing artisan and artist will have a physical place where to sell their creations and where the services of the Coworking and the Fablab will be offered to the local community.\r\n\r\n We are young in respect of other Fablab but we are very lucky since we have a great community with amazing competences.\r\n\r\nAt the moment we are working on implementing a robotic hand within the Fablab and We aim with one of the group to research and produce a low cost prosthesis arm and hand and tools for disabled people.\r\n\r\nWe are working on an original 3D Printer the Coobot of one of our group 3DPR.\r\n\r\nWe are working on how to create objects with 3D printers to help Blind people in the museum to recognize and touch a smaller version of a statue for example, this is done by the 3D ArcheoLab group.\r\n\r\nWe have already partecipated and show our project during:\r\n- Torino Mini Maker Faire;\r\n- Rome Maker Faire;\r\n- New York Maker Faire;\r\n- 3D Print Hub profesional faire in Parma (Mecspe) and in Bologna (Exposanità);\r\n- R2B part of Smau in Bologna;\r\n- FAB10 Barcellona.\r\n\r\nIn the Fablab we have the following groups:\r\n- Biohacking in collaboration with Fabiana Ciciriello;\r\n- Fablab kids (for kids from 4 to 14 years old) with Michela Grasselli and \"Le quattro Mani\";\r\n- Heritage Lab in collaboration with 3D ARCHEOLAB and Giulio Bigliardi;\r\n- Wearable and Fashion technology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLast but not least we are part of Mak-ER the regional network of Fablabs of the Region Emilia Romagna.

Most of the hardware featured in these work spaces are easily controlled by user friendly software programs installed on desktop computers no different than the ones we use at work or home. The intent of the Fab Lab is to put this sophisticated machinery in the hands of students as young as middle school exposing them to engineering and design by giving them the opportunity to turn ideas into tangible products.\r\n\r\nThe Fab Lab concept began as an outreach program at MIT that aimed to promote creativity and innovation among students. By giving students the necessary tools and fostering an environment where imagination to invent and create was encouraged, Fab Labs quickly gained popularity with fab labs now being created in opened in rural India, northern Norway, Afghanistan, Ghana, Boston and Costa Rica. Users are finding that students who are able to apply design and engineering concepts toward the creation of real things are able to learn much more than they could through just exams or textbooks.\r\n\r\nThis has definitely been the case at CITC’s fab lab, where Alaskan Native students are discovering the sky’s the limit when working within a supportive community with access to the right tools. With some basic instruction and training provided by an on-site adviser, students who often struggle in a traditional educational environment are now running many of the standard machines in the Fab Lab – 3D printers, laser and vinyl cutters – to create a wide range of products made from wood, metal and plastic. This type of hands-on learning experience exposes the students to a wide range of design, engineering and architectural concepts in a fun, holistic way that cannot be achieved in the classroom. \r\n\r\nWhen students transform a simple idea into a tangible finished product, they get an overwhelming sense of accomplishment – not to mention a lot of handy products. Some of the student-created items proudly on display in the workshop include decorative wool scarves, a Spanish-style classical guitar, personalized paper stationary, and even spare automotive parts. During the holidays, students took advantage of the workshops to create Christmas ornaments and custom silk-screen t-shirts that were given as gifts to family and friends.\r\n\r\n\r\nUntil recently, it wasn’t feasible for small operations to access this type of cutting-edge technology. CITC understands this opportunity at hand and is working toward developing multiple fab lab programs, both for youth and adults that will continue to connect people with technology through education. \r\n","slug":"citcfablab","avatar":"https://i.imgur.com/iymHWkm.png","header_image_src":"","address_1":"3600 San Jeronimo Ct","address_2":"","city":"Anchorage","county":"","postal_code":"99508","country_code":"us","latitude":61.2108446650145,"longitude":-149.810683623279,"address_notes":"","phone":"907-793-3630","email":"fablab@citci.org","capabilities":["three_d_printing","cnc_milling","circuit_production","laser","precision_milling","vinyl_cutting"],"url":"https://www.fablabs.io/citcfablab","links":[]},{"id":285,"name":"Fab Lab Madrid-CEU","kind_name":"fab_lab","parent_id":null,"blurb":"Fab Lab Madrid CEU is located at the Madrid-based Institute of Technology (EPS) of CEU San Pablo University.","description":"Fab Lab Madrid CEU is located at the Madrid-based Institute of Technology (EPS) of CEU San Pablo University.

This technology is related with the material manufacture of digitally designed models through the use of computer-controlled tools (laser cutter, CNC milling machine, 3D Makerbot and so on) and offers the possibility to read from digital files to create the physical components of the models. In Architecture, should be noted specially, the association of this technology with the development of the parametric design, through which it is possible to digitally generate models whose shapes are defined through parameters that are likely to be modified to each embodiment or singular instance.\r\n\r\nCEU San Pablo University is a non-profit and private educational institution. The history and experience of this center as a higher education institution dates back to 1933. University San Pablo-CEU has a prestigious faculty of well established professional and academic careers, the Institute of Technology (EPS, Escuela Politécnica Superior).

The facilities include a digital lab, 3D lab (including large scale laser cutter), darkrooms, print studios (lino, litho, screen printing and etching), library, individual and communal studio spaces. \r\n\r\nTashkeel currently runs up to three residencies a year, along with 6 residencies in conjunction with partner entities - Delfina Foundation London, Dubai Culture and Arts Authority and Art Dubai.  Encouraging the exchange of ideas between international and local practitioners, the non-prescriptive and process-based nature of the residencies allows visiting artists to develop projects in response to their new context, or to conduct research benefiting from Tashkeel’s resources. Residencies generally culminate in an exhibition, accompanied by activities such as talks and seminars, aiming to introduce the general public to international artists and their practice.\r\n\r\nTashkeel’s exhibition space accommodates up to five main projects a year, as well as a series of small-scale events. The programme includes solo and thematic exhibitions, screenings, workshops and seminars, fulfilling Tashkeel’s commitment to bringing art and culture to a wider audience and engaging the local community.  \r\n\r\nWe partner with both international and UAE based institutions - providing participants of their varied projects with free access to all our facilities and in exchange they host workshops or talks in their various disciplines - including, Architecture Association Visiting School, PAL Labs UK, NYU Abu Dhabi, Zayed University and American University of Sharjah.

Onderdeel hiervan is de knalgele Kaasfabriek promocontainer die mobiel inzetbaar is voor festivals, schoolpleinen en evenementen. Er is een wekelijks open inloop waar je altijd welkom bent om kennis te maken. Kijk in de agenda voor alle activiteiten.\r\n\r\n\r\nMISSIE\r\nOpzetten en uitbouwen van de Kaasfabriek tot de hub waar creatieve makers op een zo jong mogelijke leeftijd – samen met professionals en hobbyisten – delen in en bijdragen aan de groeiende “open” bron van technische kennis en vaardigheden.\r\n\r\nDROOM – DOE – DEEL\r\n\r\nIn de Kaasfabriek gaat veel om de 3D’s. Je komt binnen met een DROOM of een idee. Vervolgens ga je aan de slag met de machines. Je gaat het dus zelf DOEN. En daarna DEEL je je kennis van het maken en je eindproduct met de andere kaasmakers. Iedereen mag na het doen van de Basiscursus FabLab zelf de machines bedienen, zoals 3D printers, lasercutters, vinylsnijders en meer. Je ontmoet hier andere makers en bent samen of alleen bezig met het ontwikkelen van nieuwe producten .  Er is altijd een labmanager en/of een vrijwilliger aanwezig die je kan helpen tijdens het maakproces door kennis, vaardigheden en voorzieningen aan te bieden. De Kaasfabriek is vrij toegankelijk voor individuele creatieve “makers” als voor “makers” die projectmatig samen werken.\r\n\r\nIn een fablab wordt een maker uitgedaagd een prototype, maquette, kunstobject of ander product te ontwerpen en te maken. De Kaasfabriek heeft een ‘open’ karakter waarbij iedereen wordt gestimuleerd om kennis van het ontwerpen, het maakproces en het resultaat met elkaar te delen middels een-op-een gesprekken, door dingen vast te leggen in beeld, tekst en geluid en door het geven van trainingen en workshops.\r\n\r\nKaasfabriek FabLab regio Alkmaar is een stichting zonder winstoogmerk. De Kaasfabriek wordt mogelijk gemaakt door inzet van vrijwilligers en diverse partners.\r\n\r\nVOOR WIE?\r\nDe Kaasfabriek FabLab regio Alkmaar is er voor creatieve makers van 2 – 100 jaar uit de regio Alkmaar- Haarlem – Hoorn – Den Helder. Denk aan: vormgevers, kunstenaars, architecten, ontwerpers, modelbouwers, modeontwerpers, case modders, robotbouwers, scholieren, studenten en andere makers van producten.","slug":"kaasfabriek","avatar":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/oC2LqUHeStGayvkFDWvV","header_image_src":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/eVHm9eT5WWVzqg5tF0qQ","address_1":"Pettemerstraat 15","address_2":"","city":"Alkmaar","county":"Noord-Holland","postal_code":"1823 CW","country_code":"nl","latitude":52.6383743774346,"longitude":4.7506271767212,"address_notes":"De Kaasfabriek staat op het buitenterrein naast HAL25.","phone":"0031657175044","email":"info@kaasfabriek.nl","capabilities":["three_d_printing","cnc_milling","laser","vinyl_cutting"],"url":"https://www.fablabs.io/kaasfabriek","links":[{"id":954,"url":"http://www.twitter.com/kaasfab"},{"id":916,"url":"http://www.facebook.com/kaasfabriek"},{"id":915,"url":"http://www.kaasfabriek.nl"}]},{"id":404,"name":"District 3","kind_name":"planned_fab_lab","parent_id":null,"blurb":"We are based on Concordia University District 3 Innovation Center.

Ermacora has curated a space focusing on socio-environmental impact technologies benefitting from the opportunities of distributed manufacturing, open source hardware development and participatory design.\r\n\r\nThe ‘Machines Room’ will be open to visitors but particularly encourages ‘makers in becoming’ to use the facilities to prototype their ambitions, with resident makers available to coach them. It continues LimeWharf’s experimental approach hybridising different known formats. There will be three different parts to the Machines Room: the Makerspace, where anyone, on a membership basis, can come and use the machinery, with demonstrations from resident makers; the Academy, where people can learn new technologies \u0026 skills; and an Incubator/Accelerator, where entrepreneurs can bring ideas to life.\r\n\r\nThis addition to the already vibrant Cultural Innovation Hub which has a cafe, galleries, co-working spaces, artists and technologists in residence (Clear Village, TWSU and more), is a way to amplify the possibilities of creation onsite as well as inspiring locals of all generations that may not naturally go to a hackspace to learn about this emerging reality.\r\n\r\nThe Machines Room’s features include a laser cutter, vinyl cutter, Roland CNC, 3D printer, an electronics bench, a tool bench and sewing/embroidery machinery and an assortment of other kit invaluable to designers, artists, textile specialists and other product makers. The ‘Machines Room’ will fit in with the fabrication ecosystem in East London and be connected to the Fab Lab network as well as hosting a Maker Library in conjunction with the British Council.\r\n\r\nThe long term ambition of the initiative is to give prosumers a serious play environment that can inspire socially impactful solutions for places in need, particularly within the developing world. Promoting an ethos of self-reliance whilst also providing a platform for entrepreneurs and people who want to make change through affordable innovation, the ‘Machines Room’ connects the dots between tech, enterprise and the arts.\r\n\r\nLimeWharf’s founder, architect and curator, Thomas Ermacora, is a creative director and social entrepreneur, who wants to make the initiative an open-door ‘ecosystem’ for cultural innovation bringing together dynamics to the benefit of the surrounding area. ‘There is a dreamer in all of us that can intuitively imagine the consequence of exponential technology developments today on the future of everything around us. Wikipedia combined with 3D printing is unleashing incomprehensible opportunities that makerspaces around are exploring. I want to create a fertile ground for innovation that blurs the boundaries between science and art, and stimulate that interaction towards meaningful and impactful products and ventures.

This quickly became a nexus for those wanting to dive deep in the electromechanical realms in all ages.  This space was outgrown quickly and is still in use today.  Space 2 sprouted from the molten fragments of former cast off metal chunks and became a space to develop and manipulate in metal.  Welding, forging, and smithing shaped this small space for six students to work metal.  Space 3 grew out of a need for bigger tools and the need to involve the arts in our making discoveries.  A new art room has been slowly morphed to include 3d printers, foam milling, laser cutting, big wood working tools.  Space 3a was a natural \"burst at the seams\" location directly outside Space 3.  Material storage, big work benches, and an area to make messy.

We enable makers of all kinds to imagine, design and create using open source software and DIY equipment. We do this by working with a local and international network to actively cultivate public engagement through community-focused art, entrepreneurship, research and education.\r\n\r\nPhysically, our Fab Lab is an advanced workshop space for rapid prototyping and computer-based design.\r\n\r\nIt consists of a suite of fabrication machines, including a laser engraver, CNC routers, 3D printers and scanners, electronic cutters, digital textile machines, small board electronics, graphic drawing tablets, advanced software and more. We collaborate with several grant projects and community partners locally to provide similar tools at a variety of other locations, including public libraries and after-school centers.\r\n\r\nCulturally, the CUC Fab Lab is driven by a community of practice, people often referred to as Makers.\r\n\r\nOpen-Source Movement Makers like us are are united by the desire to share knowledge, collaborate and to “make almost anything.” Our lab is open to the public, employs both staff and volunteers and greatly values both diversity and play, as we believe these are necessary for innovation. Our network and patrons include people of all kinds: students, teens, families, entrepreneurs, artists, hobbyists, gamers, hackers, engineers, scientists, teachers, librarians, activists and more. We welcome those interested to join the conversation and discover more about who we are!\r\n\r\nFunctionally, Fab Labs encourage people to become makers by exploring the entire design process.\r\n\r\nThey do this by providing tools, human assistance and inspiration that enable people to go from (1) concepts and questions to (2) digital designs and models to (3) physical prototypes and redesigns to (4) a final product they can share, which may in turn help others begin the cycle. This process is rather unique because it is possible for people with little technological expertise to engage in design thinking to develop complex creations using technology and knowledge previously only available to expert artists and engineers. Our lab specializes in working with individuals, groups and organizations to provide makerspace curriculum and related programming.\r\n\r\nOrganizationally, our Fab Lab is a public engagement program of the Illinois Informatics Institute.\r\n\r\nWe work with a variety of units, including The Graduate School of Library and Information Science, Department of Business Administration, School of Art and Design and Institute for Computing in Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences to collaborate on grants, facilitate classes and support research. Although many places might be referred to as a fab lab, our Fab Lab is part of the global network connected to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Center for Bits and Atoms. This collaborative network connects institutions around the world with common tools, software platforms and ideologies to facilitate the open exchange of ideas and designs.\r\n\r\nPhilosophically, we believe the open source ethos of the Fab Lab inspires interest and innovation in many fields.\r\n\r\nWe strive to connect computer-based making and rapid fabrication to many areas, like art and design, computer science, architecture, engineering, mathematics, science, and technical trades. We think community access, provided at a reasonable cost and in cooperation with the global Fab Lab network, builds local capacities by enabling personal growth, economic development and cross-cultural understanding. Activities at the Fab Lab and our partner sites embody the principle of life-long learning by cultivating digital literacies, including cognitive skills like computational, divergent or critical thinking, but also related cultural competencies and other underlying traits that prove fundamental to holistic learning, such as civic engagement or confidence with art and technology.","slug":"cucommunityfablab","avatar":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/oth9pEoQQTmYJKbgbmiL","header_image_src":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/BLoZHsykSGqIfqZJm99e","address_1":"1301 S Goodwin Ave","address_2":"Art Annex 2","city":"Urbana","county":"Illinois","postal_code":"61801","country_code":"us","latitude":40.1018902,"longitude":-88.2247705,"address_notes":"It's across the street from the ACES library (the octagon-shaped building)","phone":"(217) 300-1639","email":"communityfablab@gmail.com","capabilities":["three_d_printing","cnc_milling","circuit_production","laser","precision_milling","vinyl_cutting"],"url":"https://www.fablabs.io/cucommunityfablab","links":[{"id":1532,"url":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpmcZseAYp1Vx105axSLfXw/videos"},{"id":1531,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/CUCfablab"},{"id":122,"url":"http://cucfablab.org"}]},{"id":128,"name":"FabLab Breda","kind_name":"fab_lab","parent_id":null,"blurb":"","description":"","slug":"fablabbreda","avatar":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/npMVkDRiSHOyD1ntqyha","header_image_src":"","address_1":"Veilingkade 8","address_2":"","city":"Breda","county":"North Brabant","postal_code":"4815 HC","country_code":"nl","latitude":51.5989621,"longitude":4.76685659999998,"address_notes":"","phone":"+31 6 547 24 367","email":"mail@fablabbreda.nl","capabilities":["three_d_printing","cnc_milling","laser","vinyl_cutting"],"url":"https://www.fablabs.io/fablabbreda","links":[{"id":1530,"url":"http://www.instagram.com/fablabbreda"},{"id":1529,"url":"http://www.twitter.com/fablabbreda"},{"id":1528,"url":"http://www.pinterest.com/fablabbreda"},{"id":1527,"url":"http://www.facebook.com/fablabbreda"},{"id":276,"url":"http://www.fablabbreda.nl"}]},{"id":555,"name":"FabLab Puerto Rico","kind_name":"fab_lab","parent_id":126,"blurb":"We promote design education development and a space for all community to create new ways by making and learning trough their own approach to problem solving.

We offer a variety of design services like web page and product development, graphic design, packaging and prototyping. The IDC project was created at the University of Turabo with public and private funds. FabLab Puerto Rico is the tool that takes care of the fabrication and R\u0026D services provided for small and medium business. We work with inventors, designers and commercial institutions. This commercial side of the operation of the Lab hires students and professors to promote hands on experiences with the reality of our industry.\r\n\r\n4.\tEducation -- Open to any student from any educational institutions in Puerto Rico. Fee based $30.00/ hour (on digital equipment only). Must be an academic project. FabLab PR organizes a series of free seminars for the general public on digital fabrication and traditional fabrication techniques.\r\n\r\nFabLab Puerto Rico was conceived to be a formal FabLab, and has available the equipment and the commitment to collaborate with community-based initiatives as well as design and creative industries. \r\nThe Lab is offering free access for collaborations in an effort to have open access to the general public. \r\n\r\nThe Caribbean is a new frontier and we want to share the FabLab network and its power to share and transform to the rest of our neighbors.

In FabLab Zeeland kun je met behulp van moderne computergestuurde ‘maakmachines’ zoals 3D-printers, lasersnijder, vinylsnijder en ontwerpsoftware zelf dingen (leren) maken die voorheen alleen door megaconcerns konden worden gerealiseerd. \r\n\r\nDeze informele leer- werkplaats biedt iedereen de kans en ruimte om samen op lokaal, nationaal en internationaal niveau aan nieuwe ideeën, experimenten en uitvindingen te werken. Opgedane kennis en vaardigheden worden gedeeld met iedereen. Zo wordt de afstand van “idee naar product” kleiner. Loop je al een tijd met een idee rond maar je weet niet hoe je deze kunt vormgeven? Dan ben je in FabLab Zeeland aan het juiste adres.\r\n\r\nDe werkwijze is gebaseerd op het FabLab concept, zoals dat bedacht is door Neil Gershenfeld, directeur van het Centre of Bits and ATOMs (CBA) aan het Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).  Wereldwijd zijn er meer dan 360 FabLabs operationeel die via een uniek internationaal netwerk met elkaar zijn verbonden. In Nederland zijn er ruim 38 FabLabs. \r\n\r\nKijk voor meer informatie over fablabs op de website van stichting FabLab Benelux: www.fablab.nl\r\n\r\nWaar vind je ons?\r\nFabLab Zeeland is gevestigd in ons gebouw aan de Kousteensedijk in Middelburg. Naast het exploiteren van een vast lab binnen de muren van de ZB wordt, in samenwerking met Frysklab (het mobiele FabLab van Friesland), de onderwijsbus Columbus ingericht met een tweetal 3D printers. De mediacoaches van de Columbus brengen het ‘maakonderwijs’ onder de aandacht bij een aantal pilotscholen binnen het basisonderwijs. Een ingerichte FabLabbus kan op termijn een belangrijke rol gaan vervullen in de regio.\r\n\r\nSamen met HZ University of Applied Sciences, Dok 41, Scalda, Stichting ZigZag, Provincie Zeeland en Protospace Utrecht wordt onderzocht of er op termijn een groter FabLab op de kenniswerf in Vlissingen gevestigd kan worden. \r\n\r\nMeer weten?\r\nWil je meer informatie over FabLab Zeeland?
